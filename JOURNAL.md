## 11/6/2025 - Research  

I am doing research on CoreXY printers. This includes what motors they have for what axis, how they self level, what sensors I am going to need, and how the build plate should be mounted on the z axis. Once finished with more research I am going to begin to make a parts list and make prototype designs of the printer. Some printers i'm thinking of taking influence from are the Voron printers and the Prusa Core One.

## 11/8/2025 - Rough Sketch  

After research, I finally decided on how I want to design and build my printer. In addition to the parts that I might need, I made a list with a majority of the things I will need and a very, very rough prototype sketch to see if the design I had in mind still makes sense when drawn out.
